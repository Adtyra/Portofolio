# About
Hello, I'm Aditya Rizki Ananda, a fresh graduate eager to embark on a career path focused on managing data warehouses and leveraging SQL to extract insights from complex datasets. While my formal education may be recent, I have dedicated myself to mastering SQL, recognizing its pivotal role in data management systems. Proficient in crafting complex queries, optimizing database performance, and ensuring data integrity, I am equipped to transform raw data into actionable insights.

I'm also eager to learn more about Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, understanding their significance in data integration and workflow automation. Despite being a fresh graduate, my recent experience as a web developer contracted for a governmental data management site has provided me with invaluable insights into database management principles and solidified my passion for data-driven solutions.

In my spare time, I'm continually expanding my SQL skills, exploring advanced techniques, and staying abreast of industry best practices. Whether it's fine-tuning database structures or streamlining ETL processes, I thrive on the challenge of optimizing data workflows and driving efficiency.

As I transition into the workforce, I am excited to leverage my technical expertise and SQL proficiency to contribute meaningfully in the field of data warehouse management. From designing robust data architectures to implementing effective data governance strategies, I am committed to delivering impactful solutions that maximize the value of data assets.

My [CV](https://github.com/Adtyra/Portofolio/blob/main/CV_Aditya%20Rizki%20Ananda.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase skills and my projects from graduation project until now.

## [Satu Data Indonesia Provinsi Bengkulu](data.bengkuluprov.go.id)
   ![SDI Provinsi Bengkulu](Files/SDI/Home.png)
   Satu Data Indonesia is a national scale project to link data across Indonesia. The web features a hierarchical structure: the national platform holds data from all provinces and cities, while each province and city maintains its own platform, hosting relevant data at their respective administrative levels.<br>

   The data stored on these platforms can take various formats, but the most prevalent one is XLSX, a format commonly associated with Microsoft Excel.
   
## ECDSA Based Digital Signature with QR Code Verification
   <p align="center">
     <img src="Files/qsign/Ignore/home.png" alt="homepage">
   </p>
   My graduation project tackles the issue of signature forgery in online learning environments. I developed a digital signature website utilizing ECDSA-based signatures wrapped in QR codes for enhanced security. This innovation allows users to verify signatures via QR scan or document upload, ensuring authenticity and expediting approvals, even when lecturers are off-campus. By addressing these challenges, the project aims to streamline the document signing process in remote academic settings.<br>
